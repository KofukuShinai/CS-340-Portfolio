# CS-340-Portfolio

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
-
The main advantage of working this way is demonstrating the iterative process and the efficient reuse of code.  The same CRUD module could be implimented in other databases in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
-
Approaching aproblem like a computer scientist means using what you already have created.  For many basic functions, methods have already been created without the need to reinvent the wheel.  Previous assignments in this course allowed code that was reusable and repurposable in many situations.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
-
This kind of work allows an easy to understand interface for companies to search exact huidlines on what they need with single clicks.
